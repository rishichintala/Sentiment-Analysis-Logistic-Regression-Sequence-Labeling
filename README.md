# Sentiment-Analysis-Logistic-Regression-Sequence-Labeling


Tools: PyTorch, Hugging Face, wandb, GloVe

Fine-tuned BERT ("bert-base-cased") on SST-5 achieving ~52% accuracy and outperforming LSTM baseline.

Built an LSTM-based Deep Average Network using GloVe 300d embeddings for multi-class sentiment classification.

Tuned hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size) and visualized training with wandb.

Compared model performance via classification report and confusion matrix.
